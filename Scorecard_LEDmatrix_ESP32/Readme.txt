Hello , hope you are doing good. The above code is for entering the scores of different teams in a webpage and display it in the LED matrix display using ESP 32 wirelessly (wifi). 

There are some module which are to be installed. Those are:

	1] #include <Wifi.h>
	2] #include <WifiServer.h>
	3] #include <MD_MAX72xx.h>
After installing these three and configuring the ESP32 to your wifi, the code is pretty much ready to use. Enjoy : )
